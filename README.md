# 📚 Library App

A modern, interactive library management app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows users to dynamically add, view, update, and delete book entries—all within a clean UI and without a backend.

🚀 **Live Demo:** [Library App on GitHub Pages](https://notaarryan.github.io/Library/)

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Add Books**: Title, author, page count, and read status
- 🗑️ **Remove Books**: Instantly delete books from your library
- 🔄 **Toggle Read Status**: Mark books as read/unread dynamically
- 🧠 **Form Validation**: Custom messages and regex-based input validation
- 💬 **Dialog UI**: Uses the native `<dialog>` element with custom styling
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Clean, adaptive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- 🔐 **Unique Book IDs**: Uses `crypto.randomUUID()` to track each book
- ⚠️ **Invalid Form Highlighting**: Visual feedback for required inputs

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure
- **CSS3** – Responsive design with custom themes and transitions
- **JavaScript** – Dynamic DOM manipulation and validation

## 📂 Project Structure

```
Library/
│
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure with dialog form
├── style.css           # Custom styles, animations, form themes
├── script.js           # Book logic, UI rendering, event handling
└── README.md           # Project overview and documentation
```

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Click **"+ Add Book"** to open the form dialog
2. Fill in the details (title, author, pages, and read status)
3. Submit to add the book to the library
4. Toggle the **read/unread** status or remove a book as needed

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Save and load books using **localStorage**
- Add **filtering and search functionality**
- Transition to a **React frontend** with optional backend
- User login/auth (if backend is added later)

## 📚 What I Learned

This project solidified my understanding of:

- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- Form validation and accessibility
- Modern JavaScript event handling
- CSS component styling and responsiveness
- Working with semantic HTML and the `<dialog>` element

## 🙌 A Note to Recruiters

This project reflects my ability to:

- Write clean, modular code
- Build dynamic UIs from scratch
- Implement validation and interactivity without relying on libraries
- Create responsive layouts with modern CSS techniques
